[Social networks are becoming more open, more interconnected, and more
distributed][redmonk]. Many of us in the web creation world are embracing and promoting
web standards &mdash; both client-side and server-side. Microformats, standard
APIs, and open-source software are key building blocks of these technologies.
This model can be described as having three sides: Information, Identity, and
Interaction.

Diso (dee &bull; soh) is an initiative to facilitate the creation of open,
non-proprietary and interoperable building blocks for the decentralized social
web.

Our first target is [WordPress][], bootstrapping on existing work and building out
from there.

### So what does that mean? ###

We're building Wordpress plugins that implement or build on:

 - [microformats][] like [XFN][], [hCard][], [XOXO][] — wp-contactlist, wp-profiles
 - [OpenID][] — wp-contactlist, wp-openid-server
 - [OAuth][]
 - ...and others
