title: Citizen Garden podcast on DiSo and identity in 2008
author: Chris Messina
---

[Larry Halff][] and [I][] took 30 minutes to talk about our expectations for
the new year, in particular focusing on where identity and the Citizen Web are
likely headed given current indicators.

This is the first of a (hopefully) new podcast series called [Citizen
Garden][], a collaboration between [Citizen Agency][] and [Ma.gnolia][] [is now
available][].
